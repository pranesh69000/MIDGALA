My motivation quote is,"dear amigo, spend only 5 mins to read this motivation and kickstart my day and grow,today will be my day ,
first be optimistic and don't panic,if ur feeling any pressure absorb it and handle that with ease and confidence,don't care about what ur friends and others tease about u,
u know what's the truth, build the courage to face any problem and create the solution for that problem,know to give priority to the need of the hour and give priority to urself,
what's the point in expecting love and care from others when u don't show care and respect to urself,Focus on ur goals not on holes!!!,
friends are necessary,but prefer to spend more time for urself,listen to others opinion and feedback,but use ur own brain and heart,
spend time with people who share feelings of theirs and urs,but what's the point when u don't spend time to care about urself,
if I have no work to do or want some break from something first think about sleep,then think about playing games,
or watch fun yt videos to relax myself,don't think about temporary happines,listen to music,then think about loging to WhatsApp or any social media app,
work in silence,stay humble and don't raise ur voice unnecessarily,and whenever ur think that ur distracted and wasting ur time think about ur brother "Jana", ur mother and father!!! Beauty lies in simplicity,let ur success be heard out loud!!!"
